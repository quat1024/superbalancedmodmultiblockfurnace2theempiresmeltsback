Super Balanced Mod Multiblock Furnace 2: The Empire Smelts Back
===============================================================

A terrible mistake for 0h Game Jam - http://0hgame.sos.gd/

It adds:

* Clay Lattice and Effort Star, these are just crafting ingredients.
* Balanced Furnace. When you pump in items, it smelts them and TRIPLES them!!!
  * It's not OP, though: You need to add clay blocks around it, so it's a multiblock!
  * Also it's crafted with clay and nether stars... How can it be OP?
* Balanced Sword. When you hold it, you can't take damage.
  * Craft by smelting an Effort Star in the Balanced Furnace.

I started making this mod at 2:00 AM on Sunday, November 4th, and submitted it on around 1:57AM, so if it seems a little "low effort", it's because it was made in negative 3 minutes.

Obviously "inspired" by [super balanced mod multiblock furnace](https://www.reddit.com/r/feedthebeast/comments/4pf3z1/super_balanced_mod_multiblock_furnace_has_been/) which doesn't exist anymore but fortunately the redditpost does.

CC0, but why the hell would you actually want this code? It was written for speed, not for being actually good
